#   According to https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/199#issuecomment-312942450,
#   it's recommended to commit Pipfile.lock.
#   However, in some cases, like when the Pipfile is not specific enough, or you're
#   proposing a pull request with a new dependency, it may be better to ignore it.
#   Also, in case of CI/CD, it's better to ignore the lock file since it may contain
#   packages for different OS's.
#   To ignore it, uncomment the following line:
#Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow
